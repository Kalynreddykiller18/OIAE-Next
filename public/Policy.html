                including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to
                meet these obligations. Unfortunately, no data transmission over
                the Internet or electronic storage is fully secure. Accordingly,
                and despite our reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data
                from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, OIAE Systems
                cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the Personal Data
